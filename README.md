# Encryption-Protocols-CAI

This project was part of an assignment where many 'sites' communicate with one another using key encryptions called Ouroboros and Cerebus.

**Overview:** 
The CAI subject has a list of subscriber sites (observers) because it can add or remove sites. With every random protocol change, the CAI notifies each
observer site to update their protocols, so that they are in sync with the CAI subject.

I refractored code, used design patters such as factory and decorator, created UML diagrams, and overall used SOLID design principles throughout the process.
